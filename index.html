<!-- ==> we have 3 phases in git to transfer data into github

                                    ==> working directory
                                    ==> staging/index
                                    ==> local repository

if you want to check what's the status of your files  ==> git status  

                                  ==> if file color appear in red it means files are in working directory

        transfer data from  working directory to staging / index  
                                            
                                        commands
                                                  ==> to add a specific file command is ==> git add fileName
                                                  ==> to add all changed files command is ==> git add .

                                                  ==> if file color appear in green it means files are in staging / index

        transfer data from  staging / index  to local repository ==> git commit -m "commit message is optional"
         
                                                  

                                                  ==> if file appear as nothing to commit, working tree clean it means files are in local repository

        transfer data from local repository to gitHub [centralized repository]   
        
                                                  ==> git push (or) git push --set-upstream origin branchname


       to create a branch commands are 

                                  ==> git branch branchname
                                  ==> git checkout branchname

       to create and  checkout with single command we are using this command  ==> git checkout -b branchname -->

       <!-- to take the latest code from base branch , we need to checkout to base branch and need to run this command ==> git pull -->
